OVERVIEW: This assignemnt will create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase
 to host arrival and departure data. The app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js.
This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, 
namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

1. Build UI:
    When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
        -Train Name--done
        -Destination--done
        -First Train Time -- in military time --done
        -Frequency -- in minutes --done

2. Save train data to firebase database (Refer to exercise 17 in firebase folder)
        -initialize firebase database w/ firebase script, and config info --done
        -create a variable to hold the firebase database -- done
        -add on onclick event listener to submit button
        -use event.preventDefault() method so that the form does not revert to it's original behavior
        -grab all of the user input -- done
        -store the userinput into a temporary object -- done
        -push the info in the temporary object to the firebase database --done
        -check that everything is being loaded to the firebase database --done

3. Use moment.js to compute:
    -how many minutes away the next train is --done
    -at what time the next arrival will be-- done

4. Render input onto webpage with moment.js calculations running everytime page is refreshed. --done
